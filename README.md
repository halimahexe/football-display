# football-display

At a football match, I noticed the displays used to show the players on the pitch, their numbers and who has yellow cards. Plus the score and who scored, of course.

I'd imagine there's a system behind the scenes that makes this a straightforward process to update as things change in match. And I figure I can create something similar using HTML, CSS and JavaScript - so that's the aim with this project!
